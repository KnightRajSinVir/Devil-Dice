# Devil's Dice

## Overview

**Devil's Dice** is an engaging puzzle game developed using Flutter. The game revolves around a 20-faced dice, known as the "devil's dice," where players roll the dice to accumulate points while managing their life points. The goal is to strategically roll the dice, clear the counter, and maintain life points to ultimately win the game.

## Features

- **Life Management**: Manage your life points wisely to keep playing.
- **Winning Conditions**: Achieve special conditions to win the game.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI designed with Flutter.

## Rules

1. A devil's dice has 20 faces. On rolling, a random number from 1 to 20 is added to your counter.
2. You get 3 initial rolls for free. Further rolls will deduct life points.
3. After 2 rolls, your counter clears. Rolls beyond 3 will require life points.
4. If your final counter is below 14 or above 21, you lose life points. Otherwise, you gain life points.
5. You win the game if you get three 6s on your screen, excluding the number of rolls.
